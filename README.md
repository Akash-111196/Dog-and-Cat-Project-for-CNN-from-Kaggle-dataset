# Dog-and-Cat-Project-for-CNN-from-Kaggle-dataset
This repository contains a comprehensive project for classifying images of dogs and cats using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project utilizes a Kaggle dataset consisting of thousands of labeled images of dogs and cats, making it an ideal choice for building and training deep learning models.

# Key Features
1. Data Preparation: Code and scripts for data preprocessing, including data augmentation, resizing, and normalization.
2. Model Architectures: Implementation of various CNN architectures (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50, or custom architectures) for image classification.
3. Training and Evaluation: Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for model training and evaluation, including accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix analysis.
4. Model Deployment: Instructions and scripts for deploying the trained model for real-world inference.
5. Fine-Tuning: Guidance on fine-tuning hyperparameters and experimenting with different model configurations.
